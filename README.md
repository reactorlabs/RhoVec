dplyr semantics
===============

Work in progress. See [semantics.md](semantics.md); a typeset version is
forthcoming.

This is a formalization of a (subset of) [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
plus some related [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) packages,
such as [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) and
[magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/).
